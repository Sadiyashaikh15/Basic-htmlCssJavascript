# 🎓 College Website Frontend

A basic multi-page website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It simulates a college website with several navigable sections and includes a few extra standalone pages for JavaScript practice.

## 🌐 Main Website Pages

These are part of the core multi-page college website:
- `index.html` – Homepage
- `about.html` – About the college
- `contact.html` – Contact info
- `courses.html` – List of available courses
- `department.html` – Department details
- `faculty.html` – Faculty members
- `home.html` – Alternate homepage or welcome page
## 🧩 Standalone Pages / Tools
These are separate mini projects or practice pages:
- `calci.html` – Simple calculator built with JavaScript
- `reverce.html` – Page to reverse a string or number
- `reg.html` – Basic registration form
- `timetable.html` – Static timetable layout
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
## 💡 How to Use
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `index.html` in any browser for the main site
3. Open other HTML files individually to try out standalone tools
